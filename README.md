### Description <!-- omit in toc -->
This mod adds faster hypertube entrances with a mark 2 and 3 version. The new entrances have higher build and power cost while also having increased speed. The mark 2 is a decent upgrade and makes normal hypertubes slightly fast and hypertube cannons much easier and smaller to build. But the mark 3's allow you to make a decently powered cannon with only a single entrance. Have Fun.
